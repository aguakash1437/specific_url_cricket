        <p style="font-size:30px;" align="justify">&nbsp &nbspThe Indian Premier League (IPL) (Also known as TATA IPL due to sponsorship reason) is a men's T20 franchise cricket league in India. It is annually contested by ten teams based in seven cities and three states.The league was founded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. Brijesh Patel is the incumbent chairman of IPL.It is usually held annually in summer across India between March to May and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours Programme.<br></p>
        <p style="font-size:30px;" align="justify">&nbsp &nbsp The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world. In 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues.[needs update]In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion). According to BCCI, the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.<br></p>
        <p style="font-size:30px;" align="justify">&nbsp &nbsp<br>On 13 September 2007,[14] on the back of India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[15] BCCI announced a franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was slated to start in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who spearheaded the IPL effort, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise revenue system and squad composition rules.</p>
        <p style="font-size:30px;" align="justify">&nbsp &nbspIt was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would qualify for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for two years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[14] The league's format was similar to that of the Premier League of England and the NBA in the United States.<br></p>
